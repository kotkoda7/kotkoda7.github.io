I've been through quite a lot of searching. Searching for my goals in life. Searching for what I REALLY want to do. 

I finished a few schools, some more for obligatory reasons (I had to go to school for "something"), others I had real interest in. Through these journeys I found out that what I am truely passionate about is the environment. At the same time, I've struggled with what I *really* want to do within this field. With coding, I re-discovered my other important *love* that has been hiding away since I was a child. 

When I code, time flies and I can be creative! Of course, I don't want to lie, there have already been frustrating times. Why is this code *not* working? Why, why, why, why, why? Sometimes it tuned out I didn't compeltely absorbe all the material (even though I thought I did) and other times I just missed that *little thing* (a semicolon or a star), just like when I was trying to create a simple game decades ago, with my father, on our Commodore 65! 

I learned that I just need to move on and keep on **coding**!
