I start with saying that I one of those students who spent WAAAYYY too much time on this project. I mean several weeks (though I continued on with the lessons).

I suggest you don't do that!!! 

But here are my suggestions:

1. Watch some videos (Flatiron like this one https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=_lDExWIhYKI and just YouTube it) read about gems and look at some code so you get an overall sense of what you would be doing.

2. Find a website of your interest for scraping. Check and double-check whether you can scrape it. If you can't ... MOVE ON until you find another one. 

3. Use your favorite text editor for writing your code. Create your gem's structure like Avi suggested $ bundle gem <name of gem>. Or of course you can do it manually if you prefer.

4. Plan your gem. Make notes. Just create a notes file in your structure. Start by typing there what you want your gem to do step-by-step. 

5. Start coding or if you feel you are ready. Most likely you will not be, so look at some examples of other CLI gems and see how they work and look at the code (go line by line if you need to).

6. If you get stuck GET HELP. Find your section coach and/or make an appointment (or maximum of 4) with a technical coach.

7. Try and try your gem with different scenarios. If you can, ask someone to try it who doesn't know anything about it, and see if any errors come up when running your code. (As with anything else you know what you have written too well and sometimes you fail to see the issues.)

8. Don't forget to go down a level deeper as the guideline says!

9. Don't make your code TOO complicated and no you don't have to (re)invent the wheel.

10.  And finally, do NOT think for a minute that you can't do it!

# My CLI Gem 'Irecycle'

I have a background in environmental science so I knew from the beginning that I wanted to find a project in that area.  I wanted something useful, of course. I almost immediately found a website I knew I could work on (https://search.earth911.com). 

Some things I had a hard time figuring out however. One of the main "issues" I had is that it took me awhile to arrive to a solution of how to scrape a particular webpage according to user input (i.e. find a particular web address via a zipcode and another input). It is actually not hard to do so it was a big "Is that it??" when I figured it out. There are at least a couple of ways to do it (one involves using another gem).  

Truthfully, I almost gave up and was very tempted to change my project for something "more simple". Looking back, of course, I am glad I didn't give it up.

Good luck to you if you are working on your first big project! Brace yourself, but don't give up.
