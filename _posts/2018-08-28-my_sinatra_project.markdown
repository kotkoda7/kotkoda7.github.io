This has been a difficult process for me again. There are many reasons why (including some personal), but one that I could have prevented was the model. I created first more than I needed and that started to complicate things needing me to create joins and so on. While I know how to do it, looking back it was a waste of time, as one of my models didn't have anything other than a name.  

I also had an issue that didn't get resolved until I got some 1 on 1 help, and even then the technical coach had to look into it and get back to me later as he wasn't able to figure out why something didn't work. Just to give a sense of what it was: it was something to do with 'uniq' so I don't get duplicate choices in the dropdown field(s). But for some reason 'uniq' didn't work in my code. 

I am hoping that the Rails project will go a little smoother!

My advice to you who might be doing your project right now or the near future: don't (over)complicate things, establish the minimum you can live with, and don't try to reinvent the wheel. It doesn't mean you shouldn't try anything new, because you can really learn a lot from those, but if you can't figure something out for a long time you run the risk of just getting frustrated and maybe even giving up on the project. Good luck!
